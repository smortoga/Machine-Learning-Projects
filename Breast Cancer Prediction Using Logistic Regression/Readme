Background about the project:

Using Scikit-learn associated Logistic regression model, hereby I showed how to differentiate between Benign and Malignant breat cancer. For that data set is used from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnotic) and data file in csv format (Breast_Cancer_data.csv) has been provided.

The ultimate goal of the project is to employ simple logistic regression classifier to differentiate breast cancer (non/cancerrous patients) which can be applied for other similar cases.
